This is a presentation “How to Call C++ libraries from C++” I first gave at Cppcon in 2014.  The slides alone probably aren’t very readable, but the conference plans to make video available.

I presented a much earlier version of this material at MacHack in 2002.  There is a paper “The Nitrogen Manifesto” available for that work at nitric.sourceforge.net.

The source code here is divided into three parts:

   main.cpp   an example; a simple communication program
   Po7        a library that brings (part of) POSIX to C++
   PlusPlus   a small library for making libraries like Po7

I’m releasing all of these into the public domain.  I don’t expect to do much public support or extension of this code.

Share and enjoy!

To all attendees of my 2014 15-minute "C++ Puzzlers" Lightgning Talk:

Thanks so much for attending the Lightning Talk!

I thought you might appreciate having the Puzzlers with my
little soltions attached, so I'm putting this together.

I had up to 5 to present if time permitted, but it didn't (as
I pretty much expected). I'm adding them to the archive just
for the heck of it. 

Enjoy,
